**RIFE is dead. Long live open science.**

*"This framework was forged in the fire of RIFE‚Äîa theory we put to the sword on real data, no excuses, and left for the world to audit. The code survived, even when the theory died. Now, anyone can plug in any new hypothesis, any field, and run the same bulletproof, tamper-proof, open science test‚Äîat home, for free, with receipts."*
