ðŸš€ **UNIVERSAL OPEN SCIENCE TOOLBOX v1.0.0 LAUNCHED!**

**What is it?**
A bulletproof, tamper-proof, open science framework that survived the death of RIFE theory and emerged stronger. Now anyone can test any hypothesis, any field, with full reproducibility and security.

**Key Features:**
âœ… Multi-domain scientific testing (Physics, Biology, Climate, Seismology)
âœ… Omega Kill Switch protection against malicious AI agents
âœ… MMH immutable logging for reproducible science
âœ… Hero points system for community engagement
âœ… Challenge mode with hash-based verification
âœ… 100% test success rate, bulletproof error handling

**Try it:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements_universal.txt
python BULLETPROOF_PIPELINE.py --challenge
```

**Earn Hero Points:**
- Complete test battery: +100 points
- Find edge cases: +50 points
- Submit challenges: +75 points

**Mission:**
This framework was forged in the fire of RIFEâ€”a theory we put to the sword on real data, no excuses, and left for the world to audit. The code survived, even when the theory died.

Now, anyone can plug in any new hypothesis, any field, and run the same bulletproof, tamper-proof, open science testâ€”at home, for free, with receipts.

**Challenge the framework:**
- Try to break it: `python BULLETPROOF_PIPELINE.py --challenge`
- Submit findings for hero points
- Help us make science bulletproof
