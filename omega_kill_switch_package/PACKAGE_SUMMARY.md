## 🛡️ Security Features

### Omega Violation Detection
- Detects and terminates agents claiming "Omega = True" or "Omega = False"
- Implements Axiom 1 from the formal specification
- Real-time monitoring and immediate termination

### Pattern Recognition
- Absolute truth claims detection
- Omniscience assertions blocking
- Suspicious system access prevention
- Network access monitoring

### Agent Management
- Automatic quarantine of violating agents
- Real-time security monitoring
- Comprehensive logging and metrics
- Chain-based agent validation

## 🔧 Integration Components

### For AGI Systems
```python
# Quick setup
from omega_kill_switch_package import setup_omega_protection
security_monitor = setup_omega_protection()

# Agent execution with protection
from omega_kill_switch_package import execute_agent_safely
result = execute_agent_safely(agent_id, agent_command)

# Chain validation
from omega_kill_switch_package import validate_agent_for_persistence
is_safe = validate_agent_for_persistence(agent_code)
```

### For 24/7 Operation
```python
# Continuous monitoring
class AGISecurityController:
    def __init__(self):
        self.security_monitor = SecurityMonitor()
    
    def start_continuous_monitoring(self):
        # 24/7 security monitoring
        while self.running:
            # Monitor agents and handle violations
            pass
```
