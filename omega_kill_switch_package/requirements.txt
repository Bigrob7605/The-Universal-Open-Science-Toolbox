# Omega Kill Switch Package Requirements
# For AGI System Integration

# Core dependencies (minimal for security)
# No external dependencies required - uses only Python standard library

# Optional dependencies for enhanced functionality:
# sqlite3 - Built into Python (for metrics database)
# re - Built into Python (for pattern matching)
# subprocess - Built into Python (for agent execution)
# logging - Built into Python (for security logging)
# time - Built into Python (for timing and metrics)
# datetime - Built into Python (for timestamps)

# Version requirements:
# Python >= 3.8 (for type hints and modern features)
# No external packages needed - designed for minimal dependencies

# For AGI system integration, ensure:
# - Python 3.8+ available
# - Write permissions for metrics database
# - Subprocess execution capabilities
# - File system access for logging
